        - My research experience under the supervision of Prof. Farnia at the Chinese University of Hong Kong proved to be highly beneficial, deepening my understanding of adversarial attacks and perturbations. Prof. Farniaâ€™s guidance exposed me to cutting-edge research and techniques, expanding my knowledge and providing me valuable insights. Through this project, I gained practical skills in developing low-rank adversarial attacks. This research project enhanced my theoretical knowledge, equipped me with practical skills. In this project we designed a new attack by projecting perturbations into low dimentional space. This project leads to advances in transferability of adversarial perturbations.

        - In this project, we worked on Fast Adversarial Training which suffers from Catastrophic Overfitting. CO occurs when the adversarially trained network suddenly loses robustness against multi-step attacks like Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). Although several approaches have been proposed to address this problem in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we found out that they do not perform well when applied to Vision Transformers (ViTs). In our paper we proposed a novel method of fast training which overcomes Catastrophic Overfitting in ViTs.
