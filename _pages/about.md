I am Alireza, currently in my final year of pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology.

My research interests are mainly in **Computer Vision** and **Trustworthy AI**.
My academic journey, particularly my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, has provided me with a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for AI’s transformative potential. However, it is the challenges and questions surrounding the robustness, reliability, fairness, and security of these AI systems that intrigue me the most.
