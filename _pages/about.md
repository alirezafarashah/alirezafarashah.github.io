I am Alireza, a PhD student in Computer Science at **McGill University** and **Mila, Quebec AI Institute**.

My research lies at the intersection of **machine unlearning** and **concept erasure**, with a particular focus on large-scale **vision-language and text-to-image models**. I study how undesired concepts, such as sensitive, biased, or copyrighted information, can be selectively removed from trained models while preserving their overall utility.

My academic background includes a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from **Sharif University of Technology**, where I developed a strong foundation in machine learning and computer vision. Building on this background, my current work investigates robustness, reliability, fairness, and safety in modern generative models, with the goal of developing principled methods for controllable and responsible AI systems.
